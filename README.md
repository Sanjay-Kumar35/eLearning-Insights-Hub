This project presents a Multi-Platform E-Learning Performance and Insights Dashboard created in Power BI to analyze learner behavior across platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, and edX. The dashboard consolidates data on user engagement, course progress, quiz performance, and ratings to provide a unified view of learning outcomes. It helps organizations understand learner trends, identify improvement areas, and enhance the overall learning experience using data-driven insights.
